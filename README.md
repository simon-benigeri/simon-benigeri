ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m Simon. I study Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University (MS). I'm from Paris, France, where I worked for IBM's Watson and AI consulting team. 

âš¡ Iâ€™m searching for full time AI/ML engineering roles in January 2022. If you're hiring, please reach out!

ðŸŒ± At Northwestern I work on research projects in statistical language modeling. 
- Automatically generating stories. Our current focus is on generating call and response character dialogue and to achieve control over the sentiment of a character's response. [Project repo link](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/narrative-generation)
- Improving the readability of news articles. The repo is private because we work with the Newsela dataset. A good text simplification is fluent, simpler than the source text, and preserves the meaning of the source text. We decided to focus is on improving metrics for these systems and we are experimenting with methods that measure the semantic similary of two sentences.

âš¡ I'm always trying to learn. Here are some of my recent projects:
- [Dope image classifier](https://github.com/bloodclot-inc/dope-image-classifier). My friend `mkobbi` and I wanted to improve our engineering skills. Also, you can get lost in all the ML engineering tools. So we chose a simple project, like image classification on CIFAR10, and we focus on the ML engineering aspects. It's a good way to to get experience with technologies like Pytorch lightning, optuna, weights and biases, bentoML, etc. The repo is private for now.
- [Learning about transformers](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/learning-about-transformers) is a project where I implement a transformer architecture for myself. Much of the research I read leverages transformer based architectures.
- [Improving financial trading decisions with deep RL and transfer learning](https://github.com/lukesalamone/deep-q-trading-agent) is a project where my colleagues and I implement a Deep Q learning agent to trade stocks. We "made profit" on past data but don't use this agent for your own investments.
- [LSTM language model](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/lstm-language-model) is a project where my colleagues and I learned to train a language model with LSTM. We train on Wikitext-2 and a corpus we created from downloading NY Times covid-19 related articles
